          <span class="dot"></span><b> Body mass index (BMI)</b> is a value
          derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="dot"></span> The BMI is defined as the body mass divided
          by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of
          kg/m<sup>2</sup>, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in
          metres.

    <p class="text_under_general_info"><span class="dot"></span> BMI as a single measure may not be the perfect measure of health. However, it is still a useful starting tool which can be used to determine important conditions that can more likely affect a person who is overweight or obese. It is important that a person is aware about their BMI. Many medical professionals also use it as a basis for health checkups.</p>
    <p class="text_under_general_info"><span class="dot"></span> Health insurance companies also use it as a measure to determine the premium rates. But more importantly it is an indicator for you to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The Covid-19 pandemic has made us realise how vital it is to be fit and healthy. Hence, knowing your BMI is just a step forward to being aware of your health.</p>
    <p class="text_under_general_info"><span class="dot"></span> BMI also helps you to take necessary steps to improve your health. If you are overweight, you can take measures to reduce your weight by exercising, following a proper diet etc. Similarly, if you are underweight according to BMI, you can consult your doctor about how to increase your weight following a healthy protocol. Along with BMI, one needs to understand body composition. It describes the amount of fat, bone, water, and muscle in the body. So, to attain a healthy weight range, one has to aware of body mass composition as well.</p>
