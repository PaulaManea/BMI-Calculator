        <h2>What is a “healthy lifestyle”?</h2>
        <p class="text">
          <span class="dot"></span> Ask 50 people to define what a “healthy
          lifestyle” is, and you’ll likely get 50 different answers. That’s
          because there’s no one way to be healthy. A healthy lifestyle simply
          means doing things that make you happy and feel good.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          <span class="dot"></span> For one person, that may mean walking a mile
          five times a week, eating fast food once a week, and spending virtual
          or in-person time with loved ones every other day. For someone else, a
          healthy lifestyle may be training and running two marathons a year,
          following a keto diet, and never having a sip of alcohol.

      <h1>Let's discuss them one by one</h1>
      <h2>1. Eat more vegetables</h2>
      <div class="third_section_fragments">
        <img class="third_section_img" src="../images/vegetables1.jpg"/>
        <p class="text">A 2010 analysis of prospective studies suggests consuming more veggies and fruit is associated with lower risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and premature death.<br>Although eating more vegetables is better, you don’t have to go from zero to nine servings a day. Perhaps your goal is eating one serving of vegetables at dinner. If you already do that, consider eating one vegetable or fruit at every meal.<br>Keep in mind that less-processed veggies are better. Rather than fries, try roasted potatoes seasoned with herbs or make a stir-fry of several colorful vegetables and drizzle them with a tasty vinaigrette.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>2. Swap in whole grains</h2>
      <div class="third_section_fragments">
        <img class="third_section_img" src="../images/grains2.jpg"/>
        <p class="text">Replacing refined grains with whole grains will benefit your health.<br>In a small 2017 study, 81 men and postmenopausal women were divided into two groups. Half followed a diet that contained whole grains, and the other half followed a diet that was calorically the same but contained refined grains. After 6 weeks, the whole grain group increased their resting metabolic rate (RMR). RMR is how many calories your body burns at rest.<br>Start small by replacing one refined grain each day with a whole grain — maybe it’s your breakfast toast or the pilaf you make with dinner. Experiment with different grains and flavorings to see which ones you enjoy most.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>3. Be more active</h2>
      <div class="third_section_fragments">
        <img class="third_section_img" src="../images/sport2.jpg"/>
        <p class="text">If the words “exercise” or “workout” put you off, think of this step in terms of physical activity or simply moving your body.<br>You could walk, go for a bike ride, take salsa dancing lessons, practice martial arts, or try a workout class online. The most important thing is to choose an activity you enjoy.<br>Choosing an activity you have an interest in will increase the chances that you’ll stick with it.<br>Secondly, remember that you don’t have to start with a long workout. Aim for 10 minutes a day, 5 days a week. When you feel ready, add another 5 or 10 minutes. Keep doing this until you reach at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>4. Maintain friendships</h2>
      <div class="third_section_fragments">
        <img class="third_section_img" src="../images/friendship2.jpg"/>
        <p class="text">Strong relationships and staying in communication with friends and loved ones can support mental health.<br>For one, the risk of depression is greater in people with low-quality relationships. Those with the poorest quality social relationships have more than double the risk of depression compared to people with the highest quality connections.<br>Similarly, research suggests feeling isolated is associated with an increased risk of poor self-rated health and depression. It is also associated with various health problems, like headaches, palpitations, and lower back, neck, or shoulder pain.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>5. Control stress</h2>
      <div class="third_section_fragments">
        <img class="third_section_img" src="../images/stres1.jpg">
        <p class="text">Chronic stress puts your body into fight-or-flight mode all the time. This taxes your immune system and makes you more susceptible to health problems, including:<br><span class="dot"></span> heart disease<br><span class="dot"></span> digestive problems<br><span class="dot"></span> depression<br><span class="dot"></span> high blood pressure<br><span class="dot"></span> anxiety<br><span class="dot"></span> difficulty sleeping<br>Exercise can help reduce stress by releasing pent-up energy. Physical activity can also boost the release of mood-lifting hormones called endorphins.</p>
